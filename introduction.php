He performs all forms of echocardiography for both adult and children. He is also extensively trained in Paediatric cardiology. His knowledge & experience in treating hypertension, Heart failure, Diabetes, Arrhythmia etc. are unmatchable. He believes in evidence based medicine and practice as per the international guidelines & recommendations.

						        				He believes that treating hypertension, Diabetes, High Cholesterol and other conditions may be an easier job; but preventing development of serious heart problem in these patients in future may not be an easy task. Complete evaluation of risk factors, appropriate and minimum use of medications, more stress on lifestyle modifications are key factors in preventing heart problem in an individual. Overall, educating patients and involving them in their treatment is main foundation of Dr. Om practice in field of non-invasive cardiology. He also stress more on lifestyle modifications rather than straight forward starting treatment for hypertension and other conditions.
